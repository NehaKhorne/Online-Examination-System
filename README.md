# Online-Examination-System
Python based project 
Online Examination Portal is a project that aims to provide a digital platform for users to
manage their exams through online mode. It is a comprehensive tool that allows users to track
their progress in academics. The project focuses on providing an easy-to-use interface for the
user to access their information. People often need information while on the go. Sometimes the
information required is essential to the task at hand, people use a variety of strategies to find a
way to do their tasks efficiently. The E-Diary System helps them to set down their tasks at one
place and add notes to it. It helps them save time and effort by organizing their all exams data
and results of their exams in one place. It also helps them track their progress and stay on top
of their goals. The system would be having a login system for user login. Users can log in and
update/delete/create notes.

1.1 Purpose

administrate and manage their assessments online. The system will have an easy-to-interact
interface so that even a newbie user can use it without any problems. You will have the

advantage
